# DR-Detection
Setting Up Development Environment: 
Install Python and required libraries (Flask, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, PIL).
Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.
Developing the Web Application:
Design and implement the frontend interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Develop the backend server using Flask and implement the prediction logic.
Train and save the machine learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Testing:
Test the functionality of each component individually. Perform integration testing to ensure seamless communication between frontend, backend, and machine learning model. Validate the prediction accuracy of the machine learning model using test datasets.
Deployment:
Deploy the web application on a server or hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud).
Set up a domain name and configure DNS settings if necessary.
Ensure security measures are in place to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access
